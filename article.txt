I chose this article because it describes what the latest trends in big data is.
Big Data sounded very vague and very big.  It is an iceberg in the sense that 
each time i learn something there is so much more to learn.  I am learning about
visualizaiton and using python but there is a whole infrastructure that I need to 
learn and be aware of such as the impact of cloud.  So i really enjoyed this 
article because it is a good reference for the inner workings of everyday business.
And things/techonlogy is chaning so fast I need to keep up.
